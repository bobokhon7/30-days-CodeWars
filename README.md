function findNeedle(haystack) {
  let position = haystack.indexOf("needle");

  return position != -1
    ? `found the needle at position ${position}`
    : `Your function didn't return anything'`;
}
```

</details>

  return `found the needle at position ${haystack.indexOf("needle")}`;
}
```

#### Q: Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software

> 8 kyu

###### Description:

> Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

```javascript
function correct(string) {
  //code is here
}
```

<details><summary><b>My Answer</b></summary>

```javascript
function correct(string) {
  let newArr = string.split("");
  for (let i = 0; i < newArr.length; i++) {
    if (newArr[i] === "0") {
      newArr[i] = "O";
    } else if (newArr[i] === "5") {
      newArr[i] = "S";
    } else if (newArr[i] === "1") {
      newArr[i] = "I";
    }
  }
  return newArr.join("");
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>Best Answer</b></summary>

```javascript
// Using template literals, simply return the string, with the injected 'indexOf'

function correct(string) {
  return string.replaceAll("0", "O").replaceAll("1", "I").replaceAll("5", "S");
